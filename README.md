# AutoMod Regex Generator
AutoMod Regex Generator is a website that generate and showcases regexes. It can generate regexes that prevent leetspeak such, such as using `ex4mpI3` instead of `example`. The generator is very advanced, being able to prevent substitutions with letters, numbers, symbols, and emojis, even with multiple characters. The site has a second page which shows some useful regexes, such as ones to block links, headers, etc.
